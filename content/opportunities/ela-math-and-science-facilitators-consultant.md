Teaching Lab is seeking experienced Math, ELA, and science teachers and leaders with a demonstrated commitment to racial and educational equity to facilitate high-quality, curriculum-aligned professional learning experiences with school systems across the country. Facilitators 1) lead virtual professional sessions, 2) develop client relationships, 3) coach and train Lab Leaders (local teacher-leaders who will eventually lead local professional learning in their own communities), 4) collect data and evidence of impact with the support of Teaching Lab’s Learning & Research team, and 5) give feedback on professional learning content modules to Teaching Lab’s Content Development team.

Ideal facilitators have five years of experience in education and in implementing high-quality instructional materials, successful teaching experience with students from underserved backgrounds (2 years minimum) with demonstrated evidence of impact, experience facilitating impactful professional learning for educators, and experience building and managing relationships with diverse stakeholders in an education context.
