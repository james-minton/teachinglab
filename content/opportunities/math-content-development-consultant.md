Teaching Labâ€™s Math Content Development team has created professional learning content to support teachers and school leaders in building best practices that promote rigorous and equitable instruction in middle and high school classrooms. **We are looking for a consultant to translate the previously designed in-person content for implementation in a virtual setting.**

**More specifically, the project consultant would:**

1. Review previously designed math professional learning content for School Leaders and create a syllabus outlining asynchronous and synchronous learning activities.
2. Translate professional learning content onto Moodle, our Learning Management System.

**An ideal consultant** has taught and/or coached math in a K-12 setting, facilitated and/or developed professional learning for teachers, and implemented high-quality instructional materials (e.g., Zearn, EngageNY, Eureka, Illustrative Mathematics). A consultant with experience in 1) digital content design and/or 2) interest in adapting professional learning to a high-impact virtual learning context is highly preferred.
