**ELA Content Development \[Consultant]**

Teaching Lab’s ELA Content Development team has created in-person professional learning content to support teachers in building best practices that promote rigorous and equitable instruction in ELA. We are looking for consultant support to translate the previously designed in-person content for implementation in a virtual setting. More specifically, the project consultants would:

1. Review previously designed ELA professional learning content and determine the right balance of blended asynchronous and synchronous activities for virtual implementation.
2. Design and create the accompanying materials for virtual implementation including synchronous and asynchronous session agendas, PowerPoint decks, and participant materials.

We are seeking a consultant to support our Guidebooks 3-12, and a consultant to support our EL Education portfolio.

An ideal consultant has taught ELA; facilitated and/or developed professional learning for teachers; and has knowledge and experience with the Guidebooks 3-12 ELA Curriculum and/or EL Education's K-8 ELA Curriculum. 

A consultant with experience in 1) digital content design, 2) experience with virtual learning tools, and/or 3) interest in adapting professional learning to a high-impact virtual learning context is highly preferred.
