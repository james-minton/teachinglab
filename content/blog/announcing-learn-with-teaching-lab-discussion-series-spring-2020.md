***Dear Teaching Lab Community,***

Community may look different now, but it has never been more important. As we do our best to center educational equity and serve our students from a distance, we can learn and build from our community’s perseverance and successes. In that spirit, Teaching Lab would like to announce the launch of ***Learn with Teaching Lab***, a weekly discussion series. This series will convene educators, to learn about and share educational best practices for both current virtual learning with students and teachers, as well as the reopening of school. The discussions will focus on two themes:

1. **Learning Now:**Supporting Students & Teachers Virtually
2. **Returning to School:**Supporting Systems to Reopen Successfully

***Learn with Teaching Lab*** will happen weekly starting May 18th, with recordings available the following day. Each discussion will follow the same general format:

1. **An introduction to the topic and a short presentation** of frameworks, content, and/or research by a member of Teaching Lab’s team.
2. **Reflections from the field** from an educator working on the topic
3. **An informal group discussion**(breakout rooms will be used for larger groups)

At Teaching Lab, we talk a lot about the importance of “Heart.” Heart means that we listen to educators, learn alongside them, and build community so we can collectively and equitably serve our students. During times like these, no one is going to give us the handbook or the instructions for solving our problems. Teaching Lab doesn’t pretend to know the answers either. This is why we’re excited to learn from educators as we pave a path forward, together.

Join us.

Yours, in service,

**Sarah Johnson, CEO of Teaching Lab**\

**Learning Now: Supporting Students Virtually with High-Quality Instructional Materials**\
**Monday, May 18th at 3 pm EST**\
**[Register now!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZEvde-oqjguE917EvcmuHelybKi5erP-rPS)**

***What does a meaningful student distance learning plan that’s based on a curriculum look like?***

Teaching Lab will share thinking around the design process, guiding principles, and user experience for the use of high-quality instructional materials in a virtual environment, including specific examples from distance learning plans we’ve created.

Participants will also engage in curriculum-specific break-out discussions to surface best practices and make connections between school systems using similar instructional materials remotely.

*This discussion is recommended for teachers and leaders using high-quality curriculum (but open to all).*\

**Learning Now: Virtual Adult Professional Learning**\

\
***What makes for great virtual learning for educators?***\
\
With schools mostly out of session through the end of the school year and teacher convenings over the summer potentially canceled, Teaching Lab is preparing to lead virtual professional learning for educators across the country. We’ll share some of our current best practices and plans and lead a discussion around what practitioners across the country are discovering and exploring around virtual teacher professional learning.\
\
*This discussion is recommended for all teachers and leaders interested in or supporting virtual adult learning.*

**Returning to School: Equitably Reopening Schools**\
**Tuesday, June 2nd at 3 pm ET**\
**[Register now!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZIpdeCqrT8uGtZwXjo55G-HVzitfGvXn2-R)**\
\
***As we reopen schools, how do we support the Whole Educator on behalf of the Whole Child?***\
\
We know that as students return to school, holding them back or putting them in remediation is not an equitable or evidence-based option. Remediation will only reinforce educational inequities that already exist in our school systems. There is a better way. At the same time, we need to consider the social and emotional needs of students as they are held to high academic expectations as well as the social and emotional needs of educators as they learn new practices.\
\
Teaching Lab will lead a discussion on the following questions:

* What is our vision for supporting all students to continue to engage in grade-level work when millions of students return to school in the fall after being out of school for months?
* What are the concrete systems and structures school systems should put into place to ensure all students continue to learn with an aligned high-quality curriculum?
* What specific professional learning supports do teachers need to engage in effective, manageable, and equitable instruction?

*This discussion is recommended for teachers, school leaders and school system leaders, but open to all.*



**Returning to School: Supporting Diverse Learners with Summer Learning Loss**\
**Thursday, June 11th at 3 pm EST**\
**[Register now!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZMkceuvpjgvE9YdQrZREGzrefl38Syriwea)**

***How do we support our diverse learners who have been without regular instruction for up to six months?***\
\
What can we do to support English learners and students with disabilities as they return to school and how do we help teachers use aligned pedagogical strategies in the classroom?\
\
Join Teaching Lab for a short overview of the research behind supporting diverse learners and a discussion on how to best use this research in practice this summer and fall.\
\
*This discussion is recommended for teachers and leaders who work regularly with diverse learners.*



**Returning to School: Evaluating the Success of Professional Learning**\
**Tuesday, June 16th at 3 pm EST**\
**[Register now!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZApfumgqzoqG9LeBQFLSkVxpiMZVL0PYERi)**\
\
***How do we know when professional learning for educators is successful?***\
\
Join Teaching Lab for an overview of how we evaluate the impact of professional learning (PL) in school systems as well as a discussion on how COVID-19 and school closures may need to shift school system thinking around evaluating PL.\
\
*This discussion is recommended for school system leaders and anyone interested in measurement and evaluation.*



**Returning to School: Racial Equity and High-Quality Professional Learning**\
**Tuesday, June 23rd at 3 pm EST**\
**[Register now!](https://us02web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYkdOmuqDMoG9SScLqhJsbseEfMhRZh0luI)**\
\
***How do we center racial equity in curriculum-aligned professional learning?***\
\
Professional learning often jumps to classroom practices without isolating race as a key factor in supporting educators to have courageous conversations about the racial history of our work. Teaching Lab will share an overview of our frameworks and principles on embedding racial equity in professional learning and lead a conversation around how to ensure we hold racial equity front and center as we respond to COVID-19.\
\
*This discussion is recommended for teachers, school leaders, and school system leaders interested in using a racial equity lens in the way they plan and deliver professional learning.*
