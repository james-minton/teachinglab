  America’s teaching force needs better support. 


  The adoption of new college- and career-ready standards, such as the Common
  Core, combined with the accelerating demands of the 21st Century knowledge
  economy, mean that all teachers are expected to teach to a significantly
  higher bar than a generation ago. Yet accountability efforts have placed
  pressure on teachers without the counterweight of increased support and
  development. Meanwhile, those most poorly served by the old system—low-income
  and minority students —are the groups growing most rapidly across the
  country. 


  To achieve equity and excellence in the face of these new demands, the U.S.
  needs a systemic approach to increasing the skills of its over three million
  teachers. A large body of research has established teacher quality as the key
  driver of student outcomes, yet America’s infrastructure for teacher
  improvement is remarkably ineffective: despite spending $18 billion a year on
  teacher professional development, the vast majority of teachers do not improve
  their practice over time. 


  As former teachers, we know that most educators are working hard and want to
  help all students, and that the issue is one of skill, not will. Teaching
  Lab’s approach reflects a new model for teacher improvement based on the
  intersection of curriculum implementation, professional learning, and teacher
  leadership. We believe that with this new paradigm, teaching will improve as
  much over the next 30 years as medicine has over the past 30.
