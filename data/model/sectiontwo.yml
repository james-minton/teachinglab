  Research suggests that effective professional learning incorporates three
  critical components:

      Core academic content is aligned to specific curricular materials and
      research-based practices. We refer to this as the “head” of professional
      learning. Without core content, teachers adopt new techniques that may be
      ineffective or even counterproductive and do not grow their knowledge over
      time.

      Teacher-led community is critical to build both social capital and buy-in
      from teachers. We call this the “heart” of professional learning. Without
      teacher-led community, there is low buy-in and often resentment; teachers
      feel that professional learning is not relevant to their needs and resist
      adoption of new content or techniques or passively comply.

      Professional learning is structured around repeated cycles of inquiry that
      allows teachers to apply what they learn and evaluate evidence of student
      learning. We call this the “habits” of professional learning. Without
      cycles of inquiry, new ideas are not incorporated into regular practice
      and those that are adopted are not verified using evidence of student
      learning.
