      Labs are small groups of educators working with students in the same or
      similar grade levels and subject areas that meet regularly to collaborate
      and share successes and challenges.

      a school system who facilitate the exploration of content modules within
      Labs.

      Professional learning content modules are PD session plans created by
      Teaching Lab and vetted by experts; these modules are both content- and
      curriculum-specific. Teaching Lab directly supports Lab Leaders in
      implementation of these modules through direct and virtual coaching.

      Cycles are six-to-eight-week, structured inquiry investigations,
      consisting of multiple sessions focused on curriculum-aligned content,
      practice, and evidence. Led by Lab Leaders who are coached by Teaching
      Lab. Labs typically complete between two and four cycles per year.
