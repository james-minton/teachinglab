**Summary of Position**

Teaching Lab is seeking experienced Math or ELA educators to facilitate professional learning projects with school systems in SY2019-2020.

Facilitators lead teachers and other educators in high-quality, curriculum-aligned professional learning experiences across the country. Facilitators will support one to three Teaching Lab partnership sites, working to:

* Lead on-the-ground professional learning (individually and in teams)
* Collect data
* Coach local Lab Leaders and other educators in person and virtually

As a rapidly growing nonprofit, we seek entrepreneurial individuals excited about working with clients, developing exceptional professional learning experiences, and innovating on research to radically change outcomes for students. This position has high potential for both large-scale impact and career growth.

Facilitator candidates may indicate interest in working as little as 16 hours/month (i.e., on top of a full-time role teaching or working in a school system) or may work up to an average of two days a week (note that specific days of the week will likely vary). Facilitators are hourly employees, eligible for overtime as required by applicable federal and local laws. Facilitators are not eligible for benefits.

Eligible candidates must have strong expertise in relationship management, leading professional learning, high-quality curriculum, and the Common Core or similar College- and Career-Ready state standards in their designated content area. Above all, any candidate must have a demonstrated commitment to educational equity.

**Key Responsibilities & Workstreams**

* Coach and train Lab Leaders (local teacher-leaders who will eventually lead local professional learning in their own communities)
* Collect data and evidence of impact with the support of Teaching Lab’s Learning & Research team
* Give feedback on professional learning content modules in conjunction with Teaching Lab’s Content Development team

**Areas for Growth**

Teaching Lab is committed to practicing what we preach, which means that development of our team is a key organizational priority. As a community of learners, we support one another through thought partnership, direct assistance, and opportunities to expand our own knowledge.

Teaching Lab will provide the following growth opportunities for Facilitators:

* Unparalleled networking and learning opportunities with Teaching Lab staff, board members, and experts in the field, including Student Achievement Partners, UnboundEd, EL Education, Illustrative Math, and others
* A peer community of other facilitators and educators focused on collaborating and supporting each other in their core areas of responsibility as well as longer-term plans

In addition, Teaching Lab is a fast-growing nonprofit organization; we expect to double in size annually for the next several years, which will provide pathways for career growth and expanded impact over time for interested candidates.

**Working at Teaching Lab**

This role is a one-year, hourly, part-time position, eligible for overtime subject to applicable federal and local laws. This position is not eligible for benefits. As part of the application process, candidates will indicate their availability to work anywhere from 16 hours/month up to 2 days a week.

Facilitators will begin work in the late spring or early summer (exact dates TBD with each candidate) and will work for a year-long term. At the end of the year, Facilitators may be eligible for an additional year as Facilitators or for other roles at Teaching Lab.

This position is eligible for remote work anywhere in the continental United States.

This position requires significant work-related travel (50%+ time) based on organizational needs, capacity, and season. We expect travel to be more frequent in summer and fall and lighter in the winter and spring.

As a benefit to joining the Teaching Lab team, Facilitators will engage in several virtual and in-person trainings to support delivery of best-in-class teacher professional learning with our partners

* All Facilitators, regardless of start date, will be required to attend our Facilitator Training weekend from Saturday, June 1st through Monday, June 3rd in Washington, DC. Please identify in your application if you will be unable to make those dates. (Note that in general, Teaching Lab does not require weekend travel and we expect this to be the only instance of required weekend work throughout the year. Teaching Lab will cover travel costs.)
* Facilitators will be required to complete the following virtual training before mid-June. If these dates fall during your employment (i.e., you start in April), they will be part of your regular workstreams. If they fall before your official start date, you will be asked to complete them on your own time (a small stipend will be provided):
  * April: approximately 25 hours of curriculum study (virtual/self-paced)
  * May/Early June: approximately 42 hours of content module study (30 hours virtual/self-paced, plus 12 hours of video calls to practice delivery to be scheduled during late weekday afternoons in late May and early June)

We are committed to building a sustainable organization. We love our work and want to be able to do it for years to come. This means that despite our relentless focus on impact and results for educators and students, we commit to maintaining a balance between work and other parts of our lives.
