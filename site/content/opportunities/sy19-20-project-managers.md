**Travel Required:** 50%+ depending on season

**Compensation:** Commensurate with experience 

**Summary of Position**

Teaching Lab is seeking experienced math or ELA educators to manage professional learning projects with school systems in School Year 2019-2020. Project Managers (PMs) are integral parts of Teaching Lab’s work, leading high-quality, curriculum-aligned professional learning experiences for teachers, schools, and districts across the country. 

PMs will lead professional learning in one to three Teaching Lab partnership sites over the course of the year. PMs will:

* Manage and build client relationships 
* Plan and lead on-the-ground professional learning (individually and in teams)
* Collect data
* Coach local Lab Leaders and other educators in person and virtually
* Support conversations on how to ensure long-term, sustainable professional learning practices in partnership sites
* Meet with Teaching Lab’s Partnerships team, including weekly check-ins, monthly all-PM huddles, etc. to ensure cross-team collaboration and engagement 

As a rapidly growing nonprofit, we seek entrepreneurial individuals excited about working with clients, delivering exceptional professional learning experiences, and innovating on research to radically change outcomes for students. This position has high potential for both large-scale impact and career growth.

PMs are part-time, hourly employees, ideally working 2-3 full days a week, and eligible for overtime as required by applicable federal and local laws. PMs are not eligible for benefits. 

Eligible candidates must have strong expertise in relationship management, leading professional learning, project planning, high-quality curriculum, and the Common Core or similar College- and Career-Ready state standards in their designated content area. Ideal candidates will have the unique combination of intellectual curiosity and established skill in these areas. Above all, any candidate must have a demonstrated commitment to educational equity.

**Key Responsibilities & Workstreams**

* Manage and build client relationships with Teaching Lab partner sites across the country
* Lead professional learning on site, including facilitation with teachers, principals, coaches, and other educators
* Support and grow other Teaching Lab facilitators through formal and informal training and feedback
* Coach and train Lab Leaders (local teacher-leaders who will eventually lead local professional learning in their own communities)
* Collect data and evidence of impact with the support of Teaching Lab’s Learning & Research team
* Give feedback on professional learning content modules in conjunction with Teaching Lab’s Content Development team
* Work closely with the Managing Director of Partnerships and Director of Sitework to support the goal of sustainable, independently-led Labs in client districts by co-creating multi-year sequences of learning

**Areas for Growth**

Teaching Lab is committed to practicing what we preach, which means that development of our team is a key organizational priority. As a community of learners, we support one another through thought partnership, direct assistance, and opportunities to expand our own knowledge. 

Teaching Lab will provide the following growth opportunities for Project Managers:

* Unparalleled networking and learning opportunities with Teaching Lab staff, board members, and experts in the field, including Student Achievement Partners, UnboundEd, EL Education, Illustrative Math, and others
* A peer community of other PMs focused on collaborating and supporting each other in their core areas of responsibility as well as longer-term plans 
* Internal cycles of inquiry on core topics that mirror our client-facing, external professional learning sequences

In addition, Teaching Lab is a fast-growing nonprofit organization; we expect to double in size annually for the next several years, which will provide pathways for career growth and expanded impact over time for interested candidates.

**Working at Teaching Lab**

This role is a one-year, hourly, part-time position, eligible for overtime subject to applicable federal and local laws. This position is not eligible for benefits. Candidates should be prepared to work 2-3 days per week, on average, in this role. 

PMs will begin work in the late spring or early summer (exact dates TBD with each candidate) and will work for a year-long term. At the end of the year, PMs may be eligible for an additional year as PMs or for other roles at Teaching Lab. 

This position is eligible for remote work anywhere in the continental United States. 

This position requires significant work-related travel (50%+ time) based on organizational needs, capacity, and season. We expect travel to be more frequent in summer and fall and lighter in the winter and spring. 

As a benefit to joining the Teaching Lab team, PMs will engage in several virtual and in-person trainings to support delivery of best-in-class teacher professional learning with our partners:

* All PMs, regardless of start date, will be required to attend our Facilitator Training weekend from Saturday, June 1st through Monday, June 3rd in Washington, DC. Please identify in your application if you will be unable to make those dates. (Note that in general, Teaching Lab does not require weekend travel and we expect this to be the only instance of required weekend work throughout the year. Teaching Lab will cover travel costs.)
* PMs will be required to complete the following virtual training before mid-June. If these dates fall during your employment (i.e., you start in April), they will be part of your regular workstreams. If they fall before your official start date, you will be asked to complete them on your own time (a small stipend will be provided):
  * April: approximately 25 hours of curriculum study (virtual/self-paced)
  * May/Early June: approximately 42 hours of content module study (30 hours virtual/self-paced, plus 12 hours of video calls to practice delivery to be scheduled during late weekday afternoons in late May and early June)

We are committed to building a sustainable organization. We love our work and want to be able to do it for years to come. This means that despite our relentless focus on impact and results for educators and students, we commit to maintaining a balance between work and other parts of our lives.
