Teaching Lab is a nonprofit organization with a mission to fundamentally shift the paradigm of teacher professional learning to achieve educational equity. We envision a world where teachers and students thrive together in communities that enable life-long learning and meaningful lives.

Our model is based on the best educational research and years of experience using exceptional instructional materials with teachers. Our team of experienced educators is committed to ensuring all students—especially students traditionally underserved by our school systems—meet the academic expectations necessary to succeed now and in the future. Our partners believe in the power of great teaching to inspire students at all levels to learn and grow. Together, we are building a nationwide movement for evidence-based teacher professional learning.

**Summary of Position**

Teaching Lab is seeking a **Director of Partnerships** (DoP): ELA Guidebooks to join our Partnerships Team and lead a portfolio of engagements with school systems as they implement the [Louisiana ELA Guidebooks](https://www.louisianabelieves.com/academics/ela-guidebooks) curriculum using our model for professional learning. 

Specifically, the DoP will engage in four major workstreams:

1. **Partnership development:** Build and maintain high-level district relationships, ensuring that districts build institutional knowledge of research-based professional learning practices and the Louisiana ELA Guidebooks curriculum in a way that supports independent implementation of Teaching Lab’s model over time.
2. **People management:** Lead through a lens of racial equity to support and develop a cohort of approximately ten Project Managers as they lead day-to-day implementation of Teaching Lab’s work in each community, including support and coaching on facilitation, knowledge of the Louisiana ELA Guidebooks curriculum, data collection, and client investment.  
3. **Project management:** Create staffing and project plans that support the continued development of Project Managers and Facilitators and ensure that all siteworks for the Louisiana ELA Guidebooks curriculum are efficiently and appropriately staffed. 
4. **Collaboration:** Foster a culture of collaboration with the Louisiana ELA Guidebooks team and with other members of the Teaching Lab community, including our professional learning content design team, our business and operations team, our impact and evaluation team, and external stakeholders like the Louisiana Department of Education and other professional learning organizations, to ensure success for our school system partners and the students they serve. 

As a rapidly growing nonprofit, we seek an entrepreneurial individual excited about leading a team. This position has high potential for both large-scale impact and career growth.

Eligible candidates must have strong expertise in relationship and client management, leading professional learning, project management, the Louisiana ELA Guidebooks, and the Common Core or similar College- and Career-Ready state standards. Ideal candidates will have the unique combination of intellectual curiosity and established skill in each of these areas. Above all, any candidate must have a demonstrated commitment to racial and educational equity.
