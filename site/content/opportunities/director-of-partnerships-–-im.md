Teaching Lab is seeking a Director of Partnerships (DoP) to join our Partnerships Team and lead a portfolio of engagements with school systems as they implement Illustrative Math’s 6-8 curriculum (IM) and OUR Math’s 6-8 curriculum using our model for professional learning. 

Specifically, the DoP will engage in three major workstreams:

1. Build and maintain high-level district relationships, ensuring that districts build institutional knowledge of research-based professional learning practices and the IM curriculum in a way that supports independent implementation of Teaching Lab’s model over time.
2. Manage and develop a cohort of Project Managers as they lead day-to-day implementation of Teaching Lab’s core model with partners, which includes coaching facilitators, building knowledge of the IM curriculum, collecting data, managing client relationships, maintaining operational efficiencies, and project planning.  
3. Collaborate with other members of the Teaching Lab community, including our professional learning Content Design team, our Business and Operations team, our Learning and Research team, and external stakeholders like Illustrative Mathematics and other professional learning organizations, to ensure success for our school system partners and the students they serve. 

As a rapidly growing nonprofit, we seek an entrepreneurial individual excited about leading a team. This position has high potential for both large-scale impact and career growth.

Eligible candidates must have strong expertise in relationship and client management, leading professional learning, project planning, the IM curriculum, and the Common Core or similar College- and Career-Ready state standards.

Above all, any candidate must have a demonstrated commitment to educational equity.

* Work with Teaching Lab’s Business and Operations team to support project management, staffing, performance management, and financial goals
