  Teachers are the engine behind the success of our work to shift the paradigm
  of teacher professional learning. At Teaching Lab, their voices matter. 


  Here is what some of them have to say:

  - testimonial: >-
      Teaching Lab is different because we were able to actually practice the
      strategy we learn in class with our students, and then reflect with
      colleagues on the implications for our instruction.
  - testimonial: >-
      This is 100% teacher led with relevant examples from teachers who have
      lived this. They are not just teaching to the high kids or an ideal
      classroom setting. It's real world.
  - testimonial: >-
      It was amazing, meaningful, and I knew it would benefit my students. I was
      actually listening to educators "in the trenches" that I respected and
      that have passion for education just like I do. It is my hope that we can
      continue professional development like this in the future.
  - testimonial: >-
      Teaching Lab truly creates a community of learners. I also like that we
      learn new strategies and how they connect with the state standards.
  - testimonial: >-
      I really liked the follow up session and bringing student artifacts. The
      accountability piece made me more conscience of the lessons I was
      planning.
  - testimonial: >-
      Most professional development experiences are brief and just "skim the
      surface" of the content. Teaching Lab introduces content in a more
      detailed way that encourages a more "hands-on" approach to our teaching. I
      also love that we can discuss these best practices strategies with other
      teachers from across the parish.
  - testimonial: >-
      I think that the accountability of implementation and the requirement of
      evidence made this professional learning more valuable. I also like the
      collegial format of the sessions.
