sectionHead: OUR MISSION
sectionBoldIntro: >-
  Our mission is to fundamentally shift the paradigm of teacher professional
  learning for educational equity.
body: >-
  The Teaching Lab team is dedicated to building a non-profit, teacher-led
  network that leverages grassroots organizing and research-based professional
  learning to serve all students, no matter their background or zip code.


  We believe that an equitable education system can be built by collaborating
  with communities that educate traditionally underserved students. Teaching Lab
  works to build local leadership and content expertise to develop the capacity
  of communities to sustain growth and development.  


  Teaching Lab envisions a teaching profession where teachers, in collaboration,
  own and drive a culture of learning and continuous improvement in their
  instructional practice, impacting student achievement in disadvantaged
  communities in significant and measurable ways.
