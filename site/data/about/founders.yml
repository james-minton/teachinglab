      As a first-grade teacher and later a coach, my relationships with my peers
      were integral to improving my practice. Through sharing ideas, lesson
      plans, student work and practicing together, I was able to get better
      faster. Not only did my practice improve, but my relationships with my
      colleagues helped get me through the challenging first years of being a
      teacher. They helped build my resilience to stay in the game and keep
      showing up for my kids when it would have been easy to burn out. Having a
      team to support you and stay focused on the right work was crucial.
